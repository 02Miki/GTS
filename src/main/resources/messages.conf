# |  With the presented messages, you have some tokens that you are able to process. These       | #
# |  tokens are registered through the Nucleus Token API, and can be called at any time.         | #
# |  If a token is not present but used in a String, the token will simply report a blank area.  | #
# |                                                                                              | #
