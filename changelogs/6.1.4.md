# API
* Updated Price interface to require an implementation-dependent marker, to help with potential
race conditions with source-reliant price types. All implementations must update this marker
to avoid data loss.

# Changes
* Updated expected exception points to include environment information to better help
diagnose the issue
* If a detected failure occurs during boot, GTS will now supply a dummy command executor to replace
the main command, that will indicate GTS booted into safe mode.

# Fixes
* Fixed an issue with MySQL during initialization preventing it from starting correctly
* Fixed a few clerical issues with the proxy services

# Extensions
Generations: Fixed a race condition causing prices to not receive their intended data. You can now sell pokemon again!
