# Before Upgrading to GTS 6 from GTS 5.x.x

[Please read the GTS 6.0.0 release notes for information regarding upgrading!](https://ore.spongepowered.org/NickImpact/GTS/versions/6.0.0)

# Changes
* Discord notifier will now ping roles when updates are available
* Throw a start exception if users are using a version of Sponge below 7.3
* Throw a start exception if users forget to install Protocol Control
* Send the Sponge reload event to our extensions
* You can set a value of 0 or less for max listings to allow unlimited listings per user

# Fixes
* Fixed a duplication issue regarding the stash
* Fixed an issue where auctions received from the stash with no bids were left in storage
    * These auctions were not available to the user once claimed
    * This resolves a portion of the issue where these listings were causing GTS to believe
    the user had listings published, even though the interface revealed none/some
    * On first attempt to access a user's listings, a query will be performed to verify
    and remove listings they've already claimed but are stuck in a forever waiting state.
* Fixed an issue where auctions awaiting another user's claim could affect the listings in storage for another user
    * This is the second fix to checking for max listings
    * GTS will now allow past the threshold, only if the user has claimed their portion first
    * This ensures no player can essentially block out another from selling items

# Extensions
### Reforged
* Updated default config, since we forgot to add some price controls settings to it!
* Allow for a custom minimum base price for pokemon

### Generations
* While work has started, Generations support is presently on hold due to limitations of their deployment strategy
    * Once requirements for GTS support are met by their team, progress towards this extension will continue

### Both Reforged and Generations
* Added support for preserving Dynamax Level via the cross-bridge API
