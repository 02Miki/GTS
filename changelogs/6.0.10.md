# Before Upgrading to GTS 6 from GTS 5.x.x

[Please read the GTS 6.0.0 release notes for information regarding upgrading!](https://ore.spongepowered.org/NickImpact/GTS/versions/6.0.0)

# Changes
* Implemented a new serialization strategy for items. This fixes cases of certain modded items not being handled correctly
* Inform user when they are using a snapshot build, if it's above our currently recommended version
* {{gts:active_bids}} is now async, and accepts a user's UUID. This is to allow for scoreboards and the like
to easily use this placeholder for a player

# Fixes
* Discord placeholder parsing, oops
* Small memory leak in which browser menus could continue to exist in the background, silly Sponge issue with close events
