# Before Upgrading to GTS 6 from GTS 5.x.x

[Please read the GTS 6.0.0 release notes for information regarding upgrading!](https://ore.spongepowered.org/NickImpact/GTS/versions/6.0.0)

# Dependency Updates
* Impactor 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT - For placeholders that can accept arguments & runtime dependency changes

# API Changes
These API changes were meant to be made with 6.1.0, but I messed up versioning and now they are somewhat available
in this patch release. No potentially API breaking releases will be made for patch versions again, hopefully!
* Updated to use Adventure 4.3.0, in preparation of Sponge API 8 changes
* No longer using Lombok

# Changes
* Legacy data translator will now ignore broken listings from legacy versions.

# Fixes
* Fixed auctions using an incorrect lookup for a player's last bid
* Fixed an additional case where auctions could find themselves stuck in the Stash with no way of being retrieved
