# API
* Added a DataTranslator, in which you can apply runtime changes to entries in the event of unexpected/unnecessary
data changes across updates

# Fixes:
* Prevent a race condition which could lead to a duplication during purchase
* Language files not provided will now be created for you, rather than forcing the plugin into safe mode
* Info Generator: Fixed an issue with some OS's in regards to file names
* Fixed prefix formatting yet again

# Extensions
* Reforged: 8.2 support
* Generations: Add contextual placeholders
